  I just finished an accessibility audit for a client and I decided to share
  some quick checks I perform in every site I audit and build. It's something
  that you can apply to your project right away, you don't have to learn a tool
  or a software.

  Automatic accessibility tests are good and useful. But they are no substitute
  for manual testing. Manuel shows a few practical tips on how to test in his
