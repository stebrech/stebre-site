Hey, my name is **Ste**fan **Bre**chbühl. SteBre is my personal website. Here I show [[en/projects|my side projects]] and [[en/blog|write about publishing and technical stuff]].

I am fascinated by publishing to the web and print, which is why I call myself a publishing enthusiast. {{ helpers.experience() }} years ago I started my apprenticeship as a ”Polygraf” in prepress and completed it in 2004. Since then, I have been a self-taught web designer and developer.

In summer 2022, I successfully completed the Higher Technical School of Media Economics and Media Management ([HF TSM](https://sfgb-b.ch/bildungsangebote/hoehere-fachschule-hf/hf-medienwirtschaft-und-medienmanagement)) at the School of Design in Bern.

Since the beginning of 2022 I’ve been working as a System Engineer Applications at [a&f](https://a-f.ch/).
