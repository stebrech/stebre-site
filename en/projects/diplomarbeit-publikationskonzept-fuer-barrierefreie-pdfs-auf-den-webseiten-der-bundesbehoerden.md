Essential components were to critically scrutinize the format and to make the preparation more media-neutral in order to always publish in the most suitable format.

The work itself is a *proof of concept* and is available as a website at [da-bfpdf-bund.netlify.app](https://da-bfpdf-bund.netlify.app/) as well as a PDF.
