Hidden in the name FirIA is the font Fira Sans. Everyone has their favorite font. This is currently mine ;-)

## Features of the template

- The standard font size and type width corresponds to about 50 to 70 characters per line, which ensures good readability.
- Optimized styles for PDF/Print
- The numbered headings work in the same way as in Word.
- Supports dark mode
- The colors used are from [Open Color](https://github.com/yeun/open-color)
