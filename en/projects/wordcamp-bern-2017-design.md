  On 9.9.2017 the WordPress event took place in Bern. These events are called
  WordCamp and take place worldwide with the open source community. I was part
  of the organizing team and was allowed to design the logo, t-shirts, batches
  and more.

I wrote about [the creation of the logo](https://2017.bern.wordcamp.org/2017/06/the-story-of-the-wordcamp-bern-logo/) on the official event website.

I have developed a mini style guide for a unified visual appearance.

## T-Shirt design

Included in the ticket price was a gray T-shirt with the logo, which was given to all participants. The green version was worn by the WordCamp helpers.
