description: The website for the family association in Wahlen was created in the first quarter of 2021. It is the second project that I have implemented with [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). The connection to a headless CMS was a premiÃ¨re for me and the decision was made in favor of [Netlify CMS](https://decapcms.org/).

> [!info] Update 2.2.2024
> Since June 2023 I have replaced both tools. For the website, I use Notion for content management, i.e. as a CMS backend. For the frontend, i.e. the actual website delivery in the browser, 11ty is used. With [[en/projects/notion2eleventy|notion2eleventy]] I have built an interface between the two tools.

### Winter market

In November 2021, the association organized a successful winter market in the village. For this event, I created a [landing page](https://familienverein-wahlen.ch/wahlner-wintermarkt) that consisted of an interactive map. By clicking on a number, the user could find out what the corresponding stand was offering.

## Logo design

Before the website was implemented, I was able to design the club logo. It uses the font Century Gothic, a sans serif font with a long center. The letters i and l were transformed into a smile and colorful balls were used.
