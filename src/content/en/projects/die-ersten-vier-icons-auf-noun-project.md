More icons from me on Noun Project are planned.

Noun Project is a portal that offers pictograms in vector-based SVG format. The pictograms are made available with a Creative Commons or a Free Public Domain. The number of different icons is gigantic, but the use of the portal is clearly aimed at the purchase of a premium account.
