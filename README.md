Git repository of the website [stebre.ch](https://stebre.ch).

The site uses the awesome SSG [Eleventy (short 11ty)](https://www.11ty.dev/).

## Content from Notion

As a headless cms it uses Notion.

While building it first fetches the content via Notionsâ€™s API and the the node package [`@notionhq/client`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@notionhq/client). The content will be converted to `md` with the help of the lovely node package [`notion-to-md`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/notion-to-md).

My personal configuration for `notion-to-md` is in the `fetchContent.js` and  

- fetches only posts in a specific status,
- creates a frontmatter with the metadata added in Notion,
- downloads associated images and other files,
- clean ups the generated markdown,
- and finally changes the status on Notion.
